🖨️ Print‑Doctor
Print‑Doctor is a Windows‑based tool designed to help you diagnose and fix common printer problems.
It can:

Detect your installed printers

Let you select symptoms your printer is showing

Accept error codes directly from the printer

Provide likely causes, fixes, and safe workarounds

Send a real Windows Test Print to verify the printer is working

Some printer manufacturers (especially subscription‑based models) may restrict printing when using incompatible or subscription‑locked ink cartridges. If your printer refuses to print due to cartridge restrictions, you may need to:

Use the correct cartridge type for your model

Replace subscription‑locked cartridges with standard ones

Check the manufacturer’s documentation for cartridge compatibility

Print‑Doctor cannot bypass manufacturer‑imposed ink restrictions, but it can help you identify when cartridge lockouts are the cause of printing failures.
